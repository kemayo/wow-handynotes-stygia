# HandyNotes: Stygia
A World of Warcraft addon to tell you where Stygia gathering nodes are in the Maw (requires HandyNotes)

If you want to [make a Shadehound](https://blizzardwatch.com/2021/03/11/how-to-craft-shadehound-maw-mount/) to ride in the Maw, you need to gather [Stygia Dust](https://www.wowhead.com/item=185618/stygia-dust). But where is it? I'll show you.

1. buy a [Stygia Dowser](https://www.wowhead.com/item=184870/stygia-dowser) from Ve'nari. Green glowy Stygia Nexuses will now show up on your map.
1. gather enough Stygia Dust and Silver to make 20x [Stygia Bar](https://www.wowhead.com/item=185630/stygia-bar).
